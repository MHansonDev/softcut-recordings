			<p>
				A collection of musical hardware, software and ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				What started out as an interest in recording guitar riffs quickly turned into the hobby of production and engineering.
				Along with the growing pile of Cubase projects came the purchase of Midi Devices, new instruments and DSP software.
				The idea behind Softcut Recordings is to document the advantages and understand the limitations of each piece in the setup.
				Without an understanding of the signal flow from input to output, many pieces of this setup will become paperweights rather than a useable setup.
				Falling victim to GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) is neither desireable or beneficial to the quality and workflow of each new project.
