			<p>
				A collection of musical hardware, software and ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				What started out as an interest in recording guitar riffs quickly became an obsession in production and engineering.
				Along with the growing pile of Cubase projects came the purchase of Midi Devices and Sound Processing instruments.
				The idea behind Softcut Recordings is to document the advantages and understand the limitations with each piece of the setup.
				Without a full understanding of the funcionalities within the signal flow, much of my desktop will feel cluttered by paperweights rather than instruments.
				Falling victim to GAS (Gear Acquisition Syndrome) is neither desireable, or beneficial to the workflow and quality of each new project.
